# composite

Composite is a specific sequence-based tree. Each node of a `Composite` is either a `Value` containing a payload object or a `Composite` comprising a sequence of child nodes.

A sequence is a source of data elements (all of the same type) without the stipulation of how the elements are stored, or linked, or whether they are stored at all.
